# MoSCoW Prioritization

## Must Have (M)

These are the core, non-negotiable features. Without them, the application would not be a functional e-commerce backend.

- **User Management:** Develop the complete CRUD functionality for the `Users` module. This is fundamental for an e-commerce platform.
- **Order Management:** Develop the `Orders` module, including services, controllers, and routes. The ability to create and manage orders is a core business requirement.
- **Authentication:** Implement user registration and login with JWT. Security is paramount, and protecting user data and routes is essential.

### Should Have (S)

These features are important and highly recommended for a robust and high-quality application. They significantly improve the product but are not strictly necessary for the initial MVP.

- **Data Validation:** Implement data input validation for the `Users` module to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests for the `Users`, `Orders`, and `Reviews` modules, as well as integration tests for the entire API.
- **Reviews Module:** Develop the `Reviews` module to allow users to leave feedback on products. While not critical for a basic store, it is an expected feature for an e-commerce app.

### Could Have (C)

These are nice-to-have features that can be added if time allows. They add polish and demonstrate additional skills but are not a priority for the initial release.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a `checkRole` middleware to restrict access to certain routes. This is an advanced security feature that can be added as a subsequent enhancement.
- **API Documentation:** Use a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate documentation for your API. This is a professional touch that greatly improves the usability of your project for others.

### Won't Have (W)

This category is for features that are explicitly out of scope for this project's current scope or release. Based on your roadmap, all planned features are to be implemented, so this section is currently empty.
